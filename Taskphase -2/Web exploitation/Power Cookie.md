## My approach to this challenge:- 

The link takes us to a website which prompts us to continue as guest. When we click that, it says `We apologize, but we have no guest services at the moment.`

As the name of the challenge suggests we must change the cookies such that we are not guest. Taking a look at the cookies in the inspect element, it shows a cookie named isAdmin, whose value can be changed to 1. Now reloading the page gives the flag.

## Learning Outcomes:-

1.`isAdmin` cookie: The isAdmin cookie is a common example used in web applications to indicate whether a user has administrator privileges. It might have values like true or false, or 1 for admin and 0 for non-admin, indicating whether the user has elevated privileges or not.
