# Most Cookies

Alright, enough of using my own encryption. Flask session cookies should be plenty secure! 
http://mercury.picoctf.net:35697/

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, url_for, redirect, make_response, flash, session
import random
app = Flask(__name__)
flag_value = open("./flag").read().rstrip()
title = "Most Cookies"
cookie_names = ["snickerdoodle", "chocolate chip", "oatmeal raisin", "gingersnap", "shortbread", "peanut butter", "whoopie pie", "sugar", "molasses", "kiss", "biscotti", "butter", "spritz", "snowball", "drop", "thumbprint", "pinwheel", "wafer", "macaroon", "fortune", "crinkle", "icebox", "gingerbread", "tassie", "lebkuchen", "macaron", "black and white", "white chocolate macadamia"]
app.secret_key = random.choice(cookie_names)

@app.route("/")
def main():
	if session.get("very_auth"):
		check = session["very_auth"]
		if check == "blank":
			return render_template("index.html", title=title)
		else:
			return make_response(redirect("/display"))
	else:
		resp = make_response(redirect("/"))
		session["very_auth"] = "blank"
		return resp

@app.route("/search", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def search():
	if "name" in request.form and request.form["name"] in cookie_names:
		resp = make_response(redirect("/display"))
		session["very_auth"] = request.form["name"]
		return resp
	else:
		message = "That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie."
		category = "danger"
		flash(message, category)
		resp = make_response(redirect("/"))
		session["very_auth"] = "blank"
		return resp

@app.route("/reset")
def reset():
	resp = make_response(redirect("/"))
	session.pop("very_auth", None)
	return resp

@app.route("/display", methods=["GET"])
def flag():
	if session.get("very_auth"):
		check = session["very_auth"]
		if check == "admin":
			resp = make_response(render_template("flag.html", value=flag_value, title=title))
			return resp
		flash("That is a cookie! Not very special though...", "success")
		return render_template("not-flag.html", title=title, cookie_name=session["very_auth"])
	else:
		resp = make_response(redirect("/"))
		session["very_auth"] = "blank"
		return resp

if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run()

```
FLAG: 

## My Approach to solve this challenge

I started off by searching what flask cookie and flask is ( I have written about it in the learning outcomes). 
By going through the server.py file I understood the following:
> * A random word from the wordlist is selected as the secret_key.
> * It checks if the very_auth session cookie is blank or not, if blank ,shows index.html, else goes to the /display page with the cookie set.
> * It checks if the cookie is set to admin, if it is it will redirect to the flag.html page.
> * Any other valid value: Displays a success message but denies access to the flag, rendering not-flag.html.

I first tried changing the cookie value using cookie editors, but it did not work ,it kept redirecting me to the main page.

Then, I used burpsuite to intercept the page and search for any clues. After some searching I found out that the session name, here
`eyJ2ZXJ5X2F1dGgiOiJibGFuayJ9.ZzSQ9w.Arb0fMbxEwnNjtPh0mKZbvs0cbo` had three parts, the first part is the base64 encode of the secret key, the second part is the timestamp, and the third part is the signed part.

Thus, even if we change the cookie value, it wont be a valid cookie since it is not set.

> app.secret_key: Sets the secret key for session handling. It randomly picks one of the cookie names as the secret key, which is used for signing the session data.

If the data in the cookie is modified on the client side, Flask can detect it, and the session will be invalidated.

## Learning Outcomes

1. A Flask cookie is a small piece of data that a Flask web application stores on the client (user's browser) to maintain session state or store user-specific information across requests. Cookies are essential in web development for tracking users across page requests, enabling a seamless experience as users interact with a web application.
2. Flask uses a session object that behaves like a dictionary. You can set key-value pairs in the session object, and Flask will store this data securely as a cookie in the clientâ€™s browser.
3. Flask signs the session cookie with a secret key (defined as app.secret_key) to ensure the integrity of the data. If the data in the cookie is modified on the client side, Flask can detect it, and the session will be invalidated.
