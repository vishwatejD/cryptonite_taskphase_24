# Some Assembly Required 2

http://mercury.picoctf.net:61778/index.html

**FLAG: picoCTF{  b2d14eaec72c31305075876bff2b5d}**

## My approach to this challenge:- 

This challenge is similar to the previous challenge in the some assembly required series. Even here the `.js` has some functions and methods that checks the user input with a hardcoded flag string.

ENCRYPTED FLAG: xakgK\5cNs((j:l9<mimk?:k;9;8=8?=0?>jnn:j=lu\00\00

I tried various ciphers like substitution, Vigen√®re Cipher,etc. Then I tried Xor cipher bruteforce. One of the outputs was

I tried changing the length of the key to see if i would get the flag in correct format. Turns out that I had to just remove the extra parts and it was the flag.

## Incorrect methods used:-

1. Used wrong ciphers
