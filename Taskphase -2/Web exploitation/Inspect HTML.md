# Inspect HTML
Can you get the flag? Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:60392/) and see what you can discover.
 
 **FLAG: picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_8113f7e2}**

## My approach to this challenge:- 

The challenge asks to start an instance of the challenge. After doing it, a link to a website is given. The website consists of some text on histaeus (some greek ruler) taken from wikipedia.

As the challenge name suggests, I used the combination of keys `ctrl` + `shift` + `I` to open the inspect page of the website. In the inspector pane, the code consists of the flag as a comment.

## Learning outcomes

1. The inspect page of a website is a tool in a web browser that allows users to view and edit a website's source code.  We can see the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files that make up a website.
2. We can also temporarily edit the HTML and CSS of a web page through the inspect element.
