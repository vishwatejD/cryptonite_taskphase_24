FLAG:- 

## My Approach to solve the challenge

The website takes the username and password and checks if it is true or not. So, for the password check we can bypass it by using SQL Injection
such as ' OR 1=1 -- 
* `'` denotes the start of the query
* After checking the input password, since we appended the `OR` statement ,it will always be true( 1=1). Thus, we can bypass the password check.
* -- comments all the rest of the sql query that the website is going to run.

This takes us to the next page `welcome.php`
