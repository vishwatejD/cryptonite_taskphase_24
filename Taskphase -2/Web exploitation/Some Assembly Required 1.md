# Some Assembly Required 1
http://mercury.picoctf.net:26318/index.html

**FLAG:- picoCTF{8857462f9e30faae4d037e5e25fee1ce}**

## My approach to this challenge:- 

First, I opened the website and went through the code in inspect element. In the sources window under debugger window, there is a `.js` file. There is also a webAssembly module under the wasm folder. Going through that reveals the flag at the end of the file.

What is this code doing?

> The moduleâ€™s main purpose is to check if a given input matches the hardcoded flag (picoCTF{8857462f9e30faae4d037e5e25fee1ce}).

## Learning outcomes:-

1. After a bit of searching I found out that the `.js` file is obfuscated.
2. What is Javascript obfuscation?
   > JavaScript obfuscation is the process of transforming client-side JavaScript code into a format that is difficult for humans to understand while still being executable by browsers. 
3. This obfuscated code fetches the webAssembly module to check the inputed string with the hardcoded string to authenticate.
