## My Approach to the challenge

When I saw the message "Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!" I understood that we had to change the user-Agent to PicoBrowser to make the current browser as the required PicoBrowser.

I did that using burpsuite which gave the output as follows,

It gives the message I dont trust users from other website, After some searching in the [http headers list](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-14) there is a header called referer which is used to specify the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained .

Setting the referer to http://mercury.picoctf.net:52362/ gives the following output

To make it such that the year is 2018 , we can use the date request header to set the date to any date in 2018, which takes us to the next page.

To stop tracking, I found the header called DNT which stands for donot track and we can set this value to be true

Now, to set the ip address to sweden, we can put any random ip address from sweden and use the header called X-Forwarded-For

To change the language, we can use the header Accept-Language to sv( sv for swedish). (Refer [this for language codes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp))

## Learning outcomes:-
HTTP headers are key-value pairs in HTTP messages that convey additional information about the request or response. They are crucial in HTTP communication, specifying details about the data being sent and how it should be handled. HTTP headers are typically divided into two main categories: request headers and response headers.
1. **Request Headers**

Request headers are sent by the client (such as a web browser) in an HTTP request to the server, providing information about the client, the resources requested, and preferences for the response. Key request headers include:

    Host: Specifies the domain name of the server.
    User-Agent: Identifies the client software making the request (e.g., browser type).
    Accept: Indicates content types the client can process (e.g., HTML, JSON).
    Authorization: Contains credentials for accessing a resource (e.g., for basic authentication).
    Cookie: Sends any stored cookies back to the server.
    Referer: Tells the server the URL of the page that led the client to the current request.
    Accept-Language: Specifies the preferred language for the response.

2. **Response Headers**

Response headers are sent by the server in response to a client’s request, providing information about the server’s response, such as the content and caching instructions. Key response headers include:

    Content-Type: Specifies the MIME type of the returned content (e.g., text/html, application/json).
    Content-Length: Indicates the size of the response body in bytes.
    Set-Cookie: Sets cookies in the client’s browser.
    Cache-Control: Defines caching policies for the response.
    Location: Provides a URL for redirection.
    Server: Identifies the server software handling the request.
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Defines which origins are allowed for cross-origin requests in CORS.
