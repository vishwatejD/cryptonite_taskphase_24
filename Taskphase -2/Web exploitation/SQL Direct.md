# SQL Direct

Connect to this PostgreSQL server and find the flag! psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 58114 -U postgres pico . Password is postgres

**FLAG:- picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_73b0678f}**

## My approach to this challenge:- 

First I installed postgresql using the command `sudo apt install postgresql` then executing the command given prompts us to give the password. Entering the password connects us to the sql server.

This is my first time using sql or postgresql so i looked up for and sql commands online. (https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/postgresql_create_table.php)

The database in postgreSQL mainly consists of tables. So I found out from the `help` in sql server the command to list tables is `\dt`.

We can find the list of these commands when we type `\?`.

Now I used the command `SELECT * FROM flags` which didnot work. After some searching I found out that we had to put the Schema name also.

Thus using the command `SELECT * FROM public.flags` lists the flag.
