**FLAG: picoCTF{df0bacd4}**

## My Approach to solve the question

Analysis of the code reveals that, this challenge takes input from the user as command line arguments, stores them in registers x0 and then loads them. Converts them to integers and passes them to func1 which checks which of the both inputs is greater and prints that.

Converting it to hexadecimal form gives the flag.

## Incorrect methods used:-

First I tried to run the file instead of understanding the code. There was no need to run the file to get the flag.

## Learning Outcomes:-

ARM Assembly- ARM assembly is a syntax layer that's used to program computers and is easier for humans to understand than machine code.
