# CHAINING COMMANDS

## Chaining with semicolons

The easiest way to chain commands is ;. In most contexts, ; separates commands in a similar way to how Enter separates lines.

> NOTE:-
> **Pipe** (|): Used to pass the output of one command as input to another (creates a data flow).
> **Semicolon** (;): Just runs commands in sequence, without sharing data between them.

We chain the given commands using the semicolon to get the flag.

## Your first shell Script

>  What is a Shell Script?
>
>  *  A shell script is a file that contains a set of commands that the shell can execute.
>  *  The `.sh` extension is a convention to indicate that the file is a shell script, though itâ€™s not mandatory. You could name the file anything.This is because linux uses other methods to interpret the file. You can name a script anything you like, with or without `.sh`, and it will still work as long as it is executable and has a valid interpreter specified at the start.
>  *  Shell scripts are typically used to automate repetitive tasks, batch commands, and run complex sequences of operations.

We can use various text editors like nano, vim, gedit. I usually use nano.

And then we can execute by passing it as an argument to a new instance of our shell `(bash)`. When a shell is invoked like this, rather than taking commands from the user, it reads commands from the file.

Some basic nano commands are as follows:-

We first use the command nano x.sh to make the shell script file. In the editor we write the given commands. Save using ctrl+o and exit using ctrl+x. Now we execute this command using bash x.sh to get the file.

## Redirecting shell output

All of the various redirection methods work on script files : > for stdout, 2> for stderr, < for stdin, >> and 2>> for append-mode redirection, >& for redirecting to other file descriptors, and | for piping to another command.

## Executable Shell Scripts

We make the script file similar to the previous challenge using nano and then change its file permissions using the command `chmod +x filename`. Now we can execute the file using ./filename (since we made the script file in home directory and we are in homw directory).
