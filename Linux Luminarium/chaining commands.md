# CHAINING COMMANDS

## Chaining with semicolons

The easiest way to chain commands is ;. In most contexts, ; separates commands in a similar way to how Enter separates lines.

> NOTE:-
> **Pipe** (|): Used to pass the output of one command as input to another (creates a data flow).
> **Semicolon** (;): Just runs commands in sequence, without sharing data between them.

We chain the given commands using the semicolon to get the flag.

## Your first shell Script

>  What is a Shell Script?
>
>  *  A shell script is a file that contains a set of commands that the shell can execute.
>  *  The `.sh` extension is a convention to indicate that the file is a shell script, though itâ€™s not mandatory. You could name the file anything.This is because linux uses other methods to interpret the file.
>  *  Shell scripts are typically used to automate repetitive tasks, batch commands, and run complex sequences of operations.
